    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ears freshly shucked corn</li>
            <li>1 green pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced red onion</li>
            <li>½ bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat; lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Cook the corn on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until the corn is tender and specks of black appear, about 10 minutes; set aside until just cool enough to handle. Slice the kernels off of the cob and place into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine the warm corn kernels with the green pepper, diced tomato, onion, cilantro, and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper; toss until evenly mixed. Set aside for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to blend before serving.</li>        
        </ol>
